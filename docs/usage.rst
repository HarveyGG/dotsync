Usage
=====

The basic usage syntax looks like this::

   dotsync [flags] {action} [category [category]]

Where ``action`` is one of the actions listed below and ``category`` is one or
more categories or groups to activate. If no categories are specified dotsync
will automatically activate the ``common`` category as well as a category with
your machine's hostname.

Using categories
================

When you run dotsync all of its actions will be limited to the categories that
are activated. If you don't specify any categories the default behaviour is to
activate the ``common`` category as well as a category with your machine's
hostname (e.g. ``my-laptop``).

When you run dotsync all the files in the filelist that are not part of the
active categories will be ignored. You can run dotsync with two verbose flags
``-vv`` to see what categories are currently active.

Flags
=====

.. option:: -h, --help

   Display a help message

.. option:: -v, --verbose

   Increase dotsync's verbosity level. Can be specified multiple times

   .. note::

      It is a good idea to run dotsync with at least one ``-v`` flag since no
      output will be generated by default (unless there is an error).

.. option:: --dry-run

   When specified dotsync won't make any changes to the filesystem. Useful when
   running with ``-v`` to see what dotsync would do if you run a command

.. option:: --hard

   Activates "hard" mode where files are copied rather than symlinked. Useful
   if symlinking isn't an option or if you want the dotfiles to live on the
   machine independently of the dotsync repo.

   .. note::

      If you want to use hard mode you need to specify it every time you run
      dotsync

Actions
=======

.. option:: init

   Initializes a new dotsync repository. Creates an empty filelist and also
   runs ``git init`` if the repo is not a valid git repository. You only need
   to run this once (when you set up a new dotsync repo). Running this multiple
   times has no effect.

.. option:: update

   Updates the dotsync repository. Run this after you made changes to your
   filelist or if you want to add the changes to non-symlinked files to your
   repo (e.g. encrypted files). This will save your dotfiles from your home
   folder in your dotsync repo, and also set up the links/copies to your
   dotfiles repo as needed (runs a ``restore`` operation after updating).

   .. note::

      When you run the ``update`` command dotsync will replace any files in the
      repo with those in your home folder. Make sure to run the ``restore``
      command first on a new machine otherwise you might end up inadvertently
      replacing files in your repo.

.. option:: restore

   Links or copies files from your dotsync repo to your home folder. Use this if
   you want to restore your dotfiles to a new machine.

.. option:: clean

   Removes all the dotfiles managed by dotsync from your home folder (run first
   with the ``-v --dry-run`` flags to see what dotsync plans on doing).

.. option:: diff

   Prints which changes have been made to your dotfiles repo since the last
   commit.

.. option:: commit

   This will generate a git commit with all the current changes in the repo and
   will ask you if you want to push the commit to a remote (if one is
   configured).

.. option:: passwd

   Allows you to change your encryption password.
